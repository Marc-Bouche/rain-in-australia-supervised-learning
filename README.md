# rain-in-australia-supervised-learning

## Description
#### Context | Instructions
Welcome to your Machine Learning project! This week, you’ll be diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, applying and expanding upon everything you’ve learned so far. This project is designed to be both a challenge and a learning opportunity, allowing you to explore new concepts such as supervised learning, feature engineering and more. The aim is to learn and apply new techniques you learn in the week, as well as building on what you already know.


#### Rain-in-Australia
This dataset comprises about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous locations across Australia.</br>
RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It answers the crucial question: will it rain the next day? (Yes or No).</br>
This column is marked 'Yes' if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.</br>
