# 🌧️ Rain in Australia (Supervised Learning) | Is it going to rain tomorrow?

## 📋 Description

### 🧑‍🏫 Context | Instructions
With this topic we will be diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This project is designed to be both a challenge and a learning opportunity, allowing to explore new concepts such as supervised learning, feature engineering, and more. The aim is to learn and apply new techniques.

### 🌦️ Rain-in-Australia
This dataset comprises about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous locations across Australia.  
**RainTomorrow** is the target variable to predict. It answers the crucial question: will it rain the next day? (Yes or No).  
This column is marked 'Yes' if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.
