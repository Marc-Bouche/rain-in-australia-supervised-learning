# 🌧️ Predicting Tomorrow's Rain in Australia: A Supervised Learning Approach

## 📋 Description

### 🧑‍🏫 Context | Instructions
With this topic, we dive deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This project is designed to be both a challenge and a learning opportunity, allowing exploration of new concepts such as supervised learning, feature engineering, and more. The aim is to learn and apply new techniques.

### 🌦️ Rain-in-Australia
This dataset comprises about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous locations across Australia.  
**RainTomorrow** is the target variable to predict. It answers the crucial question: will it rain the next day? (Yes or No).  
This column is marked 'Yes' if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.

## 🌐 [Streamlit App (Under Construction)](https://will-it-rain-tomorrow-in-australia.streamlit.app/)

A **Streamlit web application** for this project is currently under development!  
The app aims to make predictions on rainfall using an interactive interface. Users will be able to input weather conditions and get real-time predictions based on our trained Machine Learning models.  

Stay tuned for updates and the deployment link.  
The app is hosted on **Streamlit Community Cloud** and will be integrated into this repository upon completion.

## ⚠️ Notes
- The **Streamlit App** is in development and might not yet represent the final functionality.
